The Treaty ended the [[declaration of war|state of war]] between [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]]. It was signed on 28 June 1919 in [[Versailles]], exactly five years after the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], which had directly led to the war. The other [[Central Powers]] on the German side signed separate treaties.<ref>[[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]] with Austria; [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]] with Bulgaria; [[Treaty of Trianon]] with Hungary; [[Treaty of Sèvres]] with the Ottoman Empire; {{cite book|editor1-last=Davis|editor1-first =Robert T.|title=U.S. Foreign Policy and National Security: Chronology and Index for the 20th Century|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Santa Barbara, California|volume=1|year= 2010|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gsM1JiXAMJEC&pg=PA49 49]|isbn=978-0-313-38385-4}}</ref> Although the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]], signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the [[League of Nations]] on 21 October 1919.\r\n\r\nOf the many provisions in the treaty, one of the most important and controversial required \"Germany [to] accept the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage\" during the war (the other members of the Central Powers signed treaties containing similar articles). This article, [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]], later became known as the War Guilt clause. The treaty required Germany to disarm, make ample territorial concessions, and pay [[World War I reparations|reparations]] to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers. In 1921 the total cost of these reparations was assessed at 132&nbsp;billion marks (then $31.4&nbsp;billion or £6.6&nbsp;billion, roughly equivalent to US$442&nbsp;billion or UK£284&nbsp;billion in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). At the time economists, notably [[John Maynard Keynes]] (a British delegate to the Paris Peace Conference), predicted that the treaty was too harsh—a \"[[Carthaginian peace]]\"—and said the reparations figure was excessive and counter-productive, views that, since then, have been the subject of ongoing debate by historians and economists. On the other hand, prominent figures on the Allied side, such as French [[Maréchal de camp|Marshal]] [[Ferdinand Foch]], criticized the treaty for treating Germany too leniently.\r\n\r\nThe result of these competing and sometimes conflicting goals among the victors was a compromise that left no one satisfied, and, in particular, Germany was neither [[Appeasement#The aftermath of the First World War|pacified]] nor conciliated, nor was it permanently weakened. The problems that arose from the treaty would lead to the [[Locarno Treaties]], which improved relations between Germany and the other European powers, and the re-negotiation of the reparation system resulting in the [[Dawes Plan]], the [[Young Plan]], and the indefinite postponement of reparations at the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932]]. The treaty has sometimes been cited as a [[Causes of World War II|cause of World War II]]: although its actual impact was not as severe as feared, its terms led to great resentment in Germany which powered the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]].\r\n\r\nAlthough it is often referred to as the \"Versailles Conference\", only the actual signing of the treaty took place at the historic palace. Most of the negotiations were in Paris, with the \"Big Four\" meetings taking place generally at the French [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (France)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] on the [[Quai d'Orsay]].\r\n\r\n==Background==\r\n===First World War===\r\n{{main|World War I}}\r\n[[File:The signing of the peace treaty of Versailles.webm|thumb|thumbtime=00:01:45|Newsreel footage of the signing of the peace treaty at Versailles]]\r\nOn 28 June 1914, the heir to the throne of [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], was [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] by a [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]].{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=xxv, 9}} This caused a rapidly escalating [[July Crisis]] resulting in Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia, followed quickly by the entry of most European powers into the [[World War I|First World War]].{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1078}} Two alliances faced off, the [[Central Powers]] (led by Germany) and the [[Triple Entente]] (led by Britain, France and Russia). Other countries entered as fighting raged widely across [[European theatre of World War I|Europe]], as well as the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]], [[African theatre of World War I|Africa]] and [[Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I|Asia]]. In 1917, [[Russian Revolution|two revolutions]] occurred within the [[Russian Empire]]. The new Bolshevik government under [[Vladimir Lenin]] in March 1918 signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that was highly favourable to Germany. Sensing victory before American armies could be ready, Germany now shifted force to the Western Front and tried to overwhelm the Allies. It failed. Instead the Allies won decisively on the battlefield and forced an armistice in November 1918 that resembled a surrender.<ref>Andrew Wiest, ''The Western Front 1917–1918: From Vimy Ridge to Amiens and the Armistice'' (2012) pp 126, 168, 200.</ref>\r\n\r\n===US entry and the Fourteen Points===\r\n{{main|American entry into World War I|Fourteen Points}}\r\n\r\nOn 6 April 1917, the United States entered the war against the Central Powers. The motives were twofold: German submarine warfare against merchant ships trading with France and Britain, which led to the sinking of the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] and the loss of 128 American lives; and the interception of the German [[Zimmermann Telegram]], urging [[Mexico in World War I|Mexico]] to declare war against the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why was the Zimmermann Telegram important?|url=http://www.historyextra.com/article/bbc-history-magazine/telegram-brought-america-first-world-war|accessdate=11 January 2019|work=BBC History Magazine|date=17 January 2017}}</ref> The American war aim was to detach the war from nationalistic disputes and ambitions after the Bolshevik disclosure of secret treaties between the Allies.

It outlined a policy of [[free trade]], [[secret treaty|open agreements]], and democracy. While the term was not used [[self-determination]] was assumed. It called for a negotiated end to the war, international disarmament, the withdrawal of the Central Powers from occupied territories, the creation of a [[History of Poland during World War I|Polish state]], the redrawing of Europe's borders along ethnic lines, and the formation of a [[League of Nations]] to guarantee the political independence and territorial integrity of all states.{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005a|pp=429}}<ref>[[s:Fourteen Points Speech|Fourteen Points Speech]]</ref> It called for a just and democratic peace uncompromised by territorial [[annexation]].

The German ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' was mainly restricted to the [[German Bight]] and used [[commerce raiders]] and [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] for a counter-blockade. The German Board of Public Health in December 1918 stated that {{nowrap|763,000 German}} civilians had died during the Allied blockade, although an academic study in 1928 put the death toll at {{nowrap|424,000 people.}}<ref name=\"university2\">Grebler, Leo (1940).

This council was replaced by the \"Council of Five\", formed from each country's foreign ministers, to discuss minor matters. [[Prime Minister of France]] [[Georges Clemenceau]], [[Prime Minister of Italy]] [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[David Lloyd George]], and [[President of the United States]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] formed the \"[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]\" (at one point becoming the \"Big Three\" following the temporally withdrawal of Vittorio Emanuele Orlando). These four men met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions, which were later ratified by the entire assembly. The minor powers attended a weekly \"Plenary Conference\" that discussed issues in a general forum but made no decisions. These members formed over 50 commissions that made various recommendations, many of which were incorporated into the final text of the treaty.<ref>Slavicek, pp. 40–1</ref><ref name=Venzon439>Venzon, p. 439</ref>{{sfn|Lentin|2012|p=22}}\r\n\r\n===French aims===\r\n\r\nFrance had lost {{nowrap|1.3 million}} soldiers, including {{nowrap|25% of}} French men aged {{nowrap|18–30 and}} {{nowrap|400,000 civilians.}} France had also been more physically damaged than any other nation (the so-called [[zone rouge]] (Red Zone); the most industrialized region and the source of most coal and iron ore in the north-east had been devastated and in the final days of the war mines had been flooded and railways, bridges and factories destroyed.)<ref name=Slavicek43>Slavicek, p. 43</ref> Clemenceau intended to ensure the security of France, by weakening Germany economically, militarily, territorially and by supplanting Germany as the leading producer of steel in Europe.<ref name=Slavicek43/>{{sfn|Lentin|2012|p=21}}<ref>Brown, p. 187</ref> British economist and Versailles negotiator [[John Maynard Keynes]] summarized this position as attempting to \"set the clock back and undo what, since 1870, the progress of Germany had accomplished.\"<ref>John Maynard Keynes, ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'' (Harcourt Brace and Howe, 1920) p. 34</ref>\r\n\r\nClemenceau told Wilson: \"America is far away, protected by the ocean.

Clemenceau had told the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]], in December 1918, that his goal was to maintain an alliance with both countries. Clemenceau accepted the offer, in return for an occupation of the Rhineland for fifteen years and that Germany would also [[demilitarized zone|demilitarise]] the Rhineland.<ref>Lentin (1992), pp. 28–32</ref>\r\n\r\nFrench negotiators required reparations, to make Germany pay for the destruction induced throughout the war and to decrease German strength.<ref name=Slavicek43/> The French also wanted the iron ore and coal of the Saar Valley, by annexation to France.<ref>Slavicek, pp. 43–44</ref> The French were willing to accept a smaller amount of reparations than the Americans would concede and Clemenceau was willing to discuss German capacity to pay with the German delegation, before the final settlement was drafted. In April and May 1919, the French and Germans held separate talks, on mutually acceptable arrangements on issues like reparation, reconstruction and industrial collaboration. France, along with the British Dominions and Belgium, opposed mandates and favored annexation of former German colonies.<ref>Trachtenberg, p. 499</ref>\r\n\r\n===British aims===\r\n{{Further|Heavenly Twins (Sumner and Cunliffe)|Fontainebleau Memorandum}}\r\n[[File:David Lloyd George.jpg|right|thumb|British Prime Minister David Lloyd George|upright|alt=A man poses for a photograph.]]\r\n\r\nBritain had suffered little land devastation during the war.<ref name=\"David Thomson 1970, p. 605\">David Thomson, ''Europe Since Napoleon''. Penguin Books. 1970, p. 605.</ref> However, the British wartime coalition was re-elected during the so-called [[Coalition Coupon|Coupon election]] at the end of 1918, with a policy of squeezing the German \"'til the pips squeak\".<ref>Haigh, p. 295</ref><ref name=Slavicek44>Slavicek, p. 44</ref> Public opinion favoured a \"just peace\", which would force Germany to pay reparations and be unable to repeat the aggression of 1914, although those of a \"liberal and advanced opinion\" shared Wilson's ideal of a peace of reconciliation.<ref name=Schmitt102/>\r\n\r\nIn private Lloyd George opposed revenge and attempted to compromise between Clemenceau's demands and the Fourteen Points, because Europe would eventually have to reconcile with Germany.<ref name=Brezina21>Brezina, p. 21</ref> Lloyd George wanted terms of reparation that would not cripple the German economy, so that Germany would remain a viable economic power and trading partner.<ref name=Slavicek44/><ref name=Brezina21/><ref name=\"David Thomson 1970, p. 605\"/> By arguing that British war pensions and widows' allowances should be included in the German reparation sum, Lloyd George ensured that a large amount would go to the British Empire.<ref>Yearwood, p. 127</ref>\r\n\r\nLloyd George also intended to maintain a [[European balance of power]] to thwart a French attempt to establish itself as the dominant European power. A revived Germany would be a counterweight to France and a deterrent to Bolshevik Russia. Lloyd George also wanted to neutralize the German navy to keep the [[Royal Navy]] as the greatest naval power in the world; dismantle the German colonial empire with several of its territorial possessions ceded to Britain and others being established as [[League of Nations mandate]]s, a position opposed by the [[Dominion]]s.<ref name=Brezina21/>\r\n\r\n===American aims===\r\nPrior to the American entry into the war, Wilson had talked of a 'peace without victory'.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=3&psid=3898 |title = Digital History}}</ref> This position fluctuated following the US entry into the war. Wilson spoke of the German aggressors, with whom there could be no compromised peace.<ref>Trachtenberg, p. 490</ref> However, on 8 January 1918, Wilson delivered a speech (known as the Fourteen Points) that declared the American peace objectives: the rebuilding of the European economy, self-determination of European and Middle Eastern ethnic groups, the promotion of free trade, the creation of appropriate mandates for former colonies, and above all, the creation of a powerful League of Nations that would ensure the peace.<ref name=\"John Milton Cooper 2011 pp. 454\">John Milton Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson: A Biography'' (2011) pp. 454–505</ref> The aim of the latter was to provide a forum to revise the peace treaties as needed, and deal with problems that arose as a result of the peace and the rise of new states.<ref>Slavicek, p. 48</ref><ref name=Brezina21/>\r\n\r\nWilson brought along top intellectuals as advisors to the American peace delegation, and the overall American position echoed the Fourteen Points. Wilson firmly opposed harsh treatment on Germany.<ref name=\"John Milton Cooper 2011 pp. 454\"/> While the British and French wanted to largely annex the German colonial empire, Wilson saw that as a violation of the fundamental principles of justice and human rights of the native populations, and favored them having the right of self-determination via the creation of mandates. The promoted idea called for the major powers to act as disinterested trustees over a region, aiding the native populations until they could govern themselves.<ref>Slavicek, pp. 46–7</ref> In spite of this position and in order to ensure that Japan did not refuse to join the League of Nations, Wilson favored turning over the former German colony of [[Shandong Problem|Shandong]], in Eastern China, to Japan rather than return the area to Chinese control.<ref name=Slavicek65>Slavicek, p. 65</ref> Further confounding the Americans, was US internal partisan politics. In November 1918, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] won the [[1918 United States Senate elections|Senate election]] by a slim margin. Wilson, [[Democratic Party (United States)|a Democrat]], refused to include prominent Republicans in the American delegation making his efforts seem partisan, and contributed to a risk of political defeat at home.<ref name=\"John Milton Cooper 2011 pp. 454\"/>\r\n\r\n===Italian aims===\r\n[[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] and his foreign minister [[Sidney Sonnino]], an [[Anglican]] of British origins, worked primarily to secure the partition of the [[Habsburg Empire]] and their attitude towards Germany was not as hostile. Generally speaking, Sonnino was in line with the British position while Orlando favored a compromise between Clemenceau and Wilson. Within the negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles, Orlando obtained certain results such as the permanent membership of Italy in the security council of the [[League of Nations]] and a promised transfer of British [[Jubaland]] and French [[Aozou strip]] to the Italian colonies of Somalia and Libya respectively. Italian nationalists, however, saw WW1 as a [[mutilated victory]] for what they considered to be little territorial gains achieved in the other treaties directly impacting Italy's borders. Orlando was ultimately forced to abandon the conference and resign. Orlando refused to see [[World War One]] as a mutilated victory, replying at nationalists calling for a greater expansion that \"Italy today is a great state....on par with the great historic and contemporary states.

Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa had each made significant contributions to the British war effort, but as separate countries, rather than as British colonies. India also made a substantial troop contribution, although under direct British control, unlike the Dominions. The four Dominions and India all signed the Treaty separately from the United Kingdom,<ref name=TovProtocol/> a clear recognition by the international community that the Dominions were no longer British colonies: \"Their status defied exact analysis by both international and constitutional lawyers, but it was clear that they were no longer regarded simply as colonies of Britain.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title = The End of Dominion Status|first = F.

The [[Politics of France#The Right|French Right]] saw the treaty as being too lenient and saw it as failing to achieve all of France's demands. [[Politics of France#The Left|Left]]-wing politicians attacked the treaty and Clemenceau for being too harsh (the latter turning into a ritual condemnation of the treaty, for politicians remarking on French foreign affairs, as late as August 1939). [[Maréchal de camp|Marshal]] [[Ferdinand Foch]] stated \"this (treaty) is not peace. It is an armistice for twenty years.\"; a criticism over the failure to annex the Rhineland and for compromising French security for the benefit of the United States and Britain.{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2005a|p=426}}<ref name=Schmitt104>Schmitt, p. 104</ref><ref name=Bell22>Bell, p. 22</ref><ref name=\"Sontag, p. 22\"/><ref name=Tucker(1999)191>Tucker (1999), p. 191</ref><ref>Ripsman, p. 110</ref><ref name=\"R.

Henig 1995 p. 52\"/>\r\n\r\n===Italy===\r\nReaction in Italy to the treaty was extremely negative. The country had suffered high casualties, yet failed to achieve most of its major war goals, notably gaining control of the [[Dalmatian coast]] and [[Fiume]]. President Wilson rejected Italy's claims on the basis of \"national self-determination.\" For their part, Britain and France—who had been forced in the war's latter stages to divert their own troops to the Italian front to stave off collapse—were disinclined to support Italy's position at the peace conference. Differences in negotiating strategy between Premier [[Vittorio Orlando]] and Foreign Minister [[Sidney Sonnino]] further undermined Italy's position at the conference. A furious Vittorio Orlando suffered a nervous collapse and at one point walked out of the conference (though he later returned). He lost his position as prime minister just a week before the treaty was scheduled to be signed, effectively ending his active political career. Anger and dismay over the treaty's provisions helped pave the way for the establishment of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s dictatorship three years later.\r\n\r\n===Portugal===\r\n\r\n[[Portugal in World War I|Portugal]] entered the war on the Allied side in 1916 primarily to ensure the security of its [[Portuguese Empire|African colonies]], which were threatened with seizure by both Britain and Germany. To this extent, she succeeded in her war aims. The treaty recognized Portuguese sovereignty over these areas and awarded her small portions of Germany's bordering overseas colonies. Otherwise, Portugal gained little at the peace conference. Her promised share of German reparations never materialized, and a seat she coveted on the executive council of the new [[League of Nations]] went instead to Spain—which had remained neutral in the war. In the end, Portugal ratified the treaty, but got little out of the war, which cost more than 8,000 Portuguese troops and as many as 100,000 of her African colonial subjects their lives.<ref>Filipe Ribeiro de Meneses, ''Post-war Settlement (Portugal)'' in: 1914–1918-online.

One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty, even with reservations added by Lodge. A second group of Democrats supported the treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Senator Lodge,<ref>William C. Widenor, ''Henry Cabot Lodge and the Search for an American Foreign Policy'' (1980)</ref> comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a treaty with reservations, especially on Article 10, which involved the power of the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the US Congress.<ref>Ralph A. Stone, ''The Irreconcilables: The Fight Against the League of Nations'' (1970)</ref> All of the Irreconcilables were bitter enemies of President Wilson, and he launched a nationwide speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to refute them.

Among the American public as a whole, the Irish Catholics and the [[German American]]s were intensely opposed to the treaty, saying it favored the British.<ref>{{cite journal |first=John B. |last=Duff |title=The Versailles Treaty and the Irish-Americans |journal=[[Journal of American History]] |volume=55 |issue=3 |year=1968 |pages=582–598 |jstor=1891015 |doi=10.2307/1891015 }}</ref>\r\n\r\nAfter Wilson's presidency, his successor Republican President [[Warren G.

But I would also say in reply that empires cannot be shattered, and new states raised upon their ruins without disturbance. To create new boundaries is to create new troubles. The one follows the other. While I should have preferred a different peace, I doubt very much whether it could have been made, for the ingredients required for such a peace as I would have were lacking at Paris.<ref>[http://www.library.yale.edu/un/house/biblio.htm Bibliographical Introduction to \"Diary, Reminiscences and Memories of Colonel Edward M.

[[Wellington Koo]] refused to sign the treaty and the Chinese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference was the only nation that did not sign the Treaty of Versailles at the signing ceremony. The sense of betrayal led to great demonstrations in China such as the [[May Fourth Movement|May 4th movement]]. There was immense dissatisfaction with [[Duan Qirui]]’s government, which had secretly negotiated with the Japanese in order to secure loans to fund their military campaigns against the south. On 12 June 1919, the Chinese cabinet was forced to resign and the government instructed its delegation at Versailles not to sign the treaty.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j_ooCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 |p=60 |title=China's Political System |first=June Teufel |last=Dreyer\r\n|publisher=Routledge |year=2015|isbn=9781317349648 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/May-Fourth-Movement |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=May Fourth Movement}}</ref> As a result, relations with the West deteriorated.<ref>Britains Forgotten Army, Director/Producer Simon Chu, Radio Times, p. 61, 63 11–17 November 2017</ref><ref>The Betrayed Ally, China in the Great War, Introduction, Christopher Arnander & Frances Wood, Pen and Sword, 2016</ref>\r\n\r\n===Germany===\r\n{{See also|Stab-in-the-back legend}}\r\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R01213, Versailles, deutsche Verhandlungdelegation.jpg|thumb|German delegates in Versailles: Professor [[Walther Schücking]], ''Reichspostminister'' Johannes Giesberts, Justice Minister [[Otto Landsberg]], Foreign Minister [[Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau]], Prussian State President Robert Leinert, and financial advisor [[Carl Melchior]]]]\r\n\r\nOn 29 April, the German delegation under the leadership of the Foreign Minister [[Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau]] arrived in Versailles. On 7 May, when faced with the conditions dictated by the victors, including the so-called \"[[War Guilt Clause]]\", von Brockdorff-Rantzau replied to Clemenceau, Wilson and Lloyd George: \"We know the full brunt of hate that confronts us here. You demand from us to confess we were the only guilty party of war; such a confession in my mouth would be a lie.\"<ref>Foreign Minister Brockdorff-Ranzau when faced with the conditions on 7 May: \"Wir kennen die Wucht des Hasses, die uns hier entgegentritt.

They referred to the treaty as \"the ''[[Diktat]]''\" since its terms were presented to Germany on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Germany's first democratically elected head of government, [[Philipp Scheidemann]], resigned rather than sign the treaty. In a passionate speech before the National Assembly on 12 May 1919, he called the treaty a \"murderous plan\" and exclaimed,\r\n—\r\n{{quote|Which hand, trying to put us in chains like these, would not wither? The treaty is unacceptable.<ref>Lauteinann, Geschichten in Quellen Bd. 6, S. 129.</ref>}}\r\n\r\nAfter Scheidemann's resignation, a new coalition government was formed under [[Gustav Bauer]]. [[President of Germany|President]] [[Friedrich Ebert]] knew that Germany was in an impossible situation. Although he shared his countrymen's disgust with the treaty, he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it. He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty, the Allies would invade Germany from the west—and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion. With this in mind, he asked [[Field Marshal (Germany)|Field Marshal]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war. If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out, Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty. Hindenburg—after prodding from his chief of staff, [[Wilhelm Groener]]—concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale. However, rather than inform Ebert himself, he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities. Upon receiving this, the new government recommended signing the treaty. The [[Weimar National Assembly|National Assembly]] voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138, with five abstentions (there were 421 delegates in total). This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline. Foreign minister [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]] and colonial minister [[Johannes Bell]] travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany. The treaty was signed on 28 June 1919 and ratified by the National Assembly on 9 July by a vote of 209 to 116.<ref>{{cite book|first=Koppel S.|last=Pinson|title=Modern Germany: Its History and Civilization| edition= 13th printing|year=1964|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|page=397 f|isbn=0-88133-434-0}}</ref>\r\n[[File:Mass demonstration in front of the Reichstag against the Treaty of Versailles.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstration against the treaty in front of the [[Reichstag building|''Reichstag'']]]]\r\n\r\n===Japan===\r\nThe Japanese felt they had been treated unfairly by the Allies, notably by the United States, France, and Great Britain, in the Treaty, for that they got as what they saw as not enough in return for their efforts against the German Empire during the course of the war. Japan attempted to amend [[Racial Equality Proposal]] in the treaty, which would require racial equality among members of the [[League of Nations]]. The amendment had broad support, but was effectively declined when it was rejected by the United States and [[Australia]]. Japanese nationalism grew in response to their growing mistrust of Western powers. As a result, Japan became alienated among world powers, allowing it to pursue its own strategic interests in Asia and the Pacific.\r\n\r\n==Implementation==\r\n{{further|Aftermath of World War I}}\r\n===Reparations===\r\n{{main|World War I reparations}}\r\n\r\nOn 5 May 1921, the reparation Commission established the London Schedule of Payments and a final reparation sum of {{nowrap|132 billion}} gold marks to be demanded of all the Central Powers. This was the public assessment of what the Central Powers combined could pay, and was also a compromise between Belgian, British, and French demands and assessments. Furthermore, the Commission recognized that the Central Powers could pay little and that the burden would fall upon Germany. As a result, the sum was split into different categories, of which Germany was only required to pay {{nowrap|50 billion}} gold marks {{nowrap|({{US$|12.5&nbsp;billion)}}}}; this being the genuine assessment of the Commission on what Germany could pay, and allowed the Allied powers to save face with the public by presenting a higher figure. Furthermore, payments made between 1919 and 1921 were taken into account reducing the sum to 41&nbsp;billion gold marks.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=236–237}}{{sfn|Ferguson|1998|p=414}}\r\n\r\nIn order to meet this sum, Germany could pay in cash or kind: coal, timber, chemical dyes, pharmaceuticals, livestock, agricultural machines, construction materials, and factory machinery. Germany's assistance with the restoration of the university library of [[Leuven]], which was destroyed by the Germans on 25 August 1914, was also credited towards the sum. Territorial changes imposed by the treaty were also factored in.{{sfn|Marks|1978|pp=223–234}}{{sfn|Kramer|2008|p=10}} The payment schedule required {{nowrap|{{US$|250 million}}}} within twenty-five days and then {{nowrap|{{US$|500 million}}}} annually, plus 26 per cent of the value of German exports.

For example, a 1921 German Government memo detailed 300 acts of violence from colonial troops, which included 65 murders and 170 sexual offenses.

Nonetheless, even the payment of this small percentage of the original reparations (132&nbsp;billion [[German gold mark|gold marks]]) still placed a significant burden on the German economy. Although the causes of the devastating [[Inflation in the Weimar Republic|post-war hyperinflation]] are complex and disputed, Germans blamed the near-collapse of their economy on the treaty, and some economists estimated that the reparations accounted for as much as one-third of the hyper-inflation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.history.com/news/treaty-of-versailles-provisions | title=The Treaty of Versailles Punished Defeated Germany with These Provisions}}</ref>\r\n\r\nIn March 1921, French and Belgian troops occupied Duisburg, Düsseldorf, and other areas which formed part of the demilitarized Rhineland, according to the Treaty of Versailles. In January 1923, French and Belgian forces occupied the rest of the Ruhr area as a reprisal after Germany failed to fulfill reparation payments demanded by the Versailles Treaty. The German government answered with \"passive resistance\", which meant that coal miners and railway workers refused to obey any instructions by the occupation forces. Production and transportation came to a standstill, but the financial consequences contributed to German hyperinflation and completely ruined public finances in Germany. Consequently, passive resistance was called off in late 1923. The end of passive resistance in the Ruhr allowed Germany to undertake a currency reform and to negotiate the [[Dawes Plan]], which led to the withdrawal of French and Belgian troops from the Ruhr Area in 1925.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ruhr-occupation |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Ruhr occupation}}</ref>\r\n\r\n===Military===\r\nIn 1920, the head of the ''Reichswehr'' [[Hans von Seeckt]] clandestinely re-established the General Staff, by expanding the ''[[Truppenamt]]'' (Troop Office); purportedly a human resources section of the army.<ref>Zaloga, p. 13</ref><ref>Michael Geyer, ''Deutsche Rüstungspolitik 1860 bis 1980'', Frankfurt 1984</ref> In March, {{nowrap|18,000}} German troops entered the Rhineland under the guise of attempting to quell possible unrest by communists and in doing so violated the demilitarized zone.

The Council of Four paid no attention to these issues, being preoccupied with others—Clemenceau to crush the economic life of his enemy, Lloyd George to do a deal and bring home something which would pass muster for a week, the President to do nothing that was not just and right. It is an extraordinary fact that the fundamental economic problems of a Europe starving and disintegrating before their eyes, was the one question in which it was impossible to arouse the interest of the Four.

(20 February 1994). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903EED81438F933A15751C0A962958260 \"Over There, and There, and There.\"] Review of: \"A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II,\" by Gerhard L. Weinberg. New York: Cambridge University Press.</ref>) that the treaty was in fact quite advantageous to Germany. The Bismarckian Reich was maintained as a political unit instead of being broken up, and Germany largely escaped post-war military occupation (in contrast to the situation following World War II). In a 1995 essay, Weinberg noted that with the disappearance of [[Austria-Hungary]] and with [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] withdrawn from Europe, that Germany was now the dominant power in [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard ''Germany, Hitler and World War II'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 16.</ref>\r\n\r\nThe British military historian [[Correlli Barnett]] claimed that the Treaty of Versailles was \"extremely lenient in comparison with the [[Septemberprogramm|peace terms]] that Germany herself, when she was expecting to win the war, had had in mind to impose on the Allies\". Furthermore, he claimed, it was \"hardly a slap on the wrist\" when contrasted with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that Germany had imposed on a defeated [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] in March 1918, which had taken away a third of Russia's population (albeit mostly of non-[[Russian people|Russian]] ethnicity), one-half of Russia's industrial undertakings and nine-tenths of Russia's coal mines, coupled with an [[indemnity]] of six billion [[German Papiermark|marks]].<ref>Correlli Barnett, ''The Collapse of British Power'' (London: Pan, 2002), p. 392.</ref> Eventually, even under the \"cruel\" terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany's economy had been restored to its pre-war status.\r\n\r\nBarnett also claims that, in strategic terms, Germany was in fact in a superior position following the Treaty than she had been in 1914. Germany's eastern frontiers faced Russia and Austria, who had both in the past balanced German power. Barnett asserts that its post-war eastern borders were safer, because the former [[Austrian Empire]] fractured after the war into smaller, weaker states, Russia was wracked by [[Russian Revolution|revolution]] and [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], and the newly restored [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] was no match for even a defeated Germany. In the West, Germany was balanced only by [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Belgium (1918–40)|Belgium]], both of which were smaller in population and less economically vibrant than Germany. Barnett concludes by saying that instead of weakening Germany, the treaty \"much enhanced\" German power.<ref>Barnett, p. 316.</ref> Britain and France should have (according to Barnett) \"divided and permanently weakened\" Germany by undoing Bismarck's work and partitioning Germany into smaller, weaker states so it could never have disrupted the peace of Europe again.<ref>Barnett, p. 318.</ref> By failing to do this and therefore not solving the problem of German power and restoring the equilibrium of Europe, Britain \"had failed in her main purpose in taking part in the Great War\".<ref>Barnett, p. 319.</ref>\r\n[[File:Treaty of Versailles Reparations -- Let's see you collect.png|thumb|American political cartoon depicting the contemporary view of German reparations, 1921|upright]]\r\nThe British historian of modern Germany, [[Richard J. Evans]], wrote that during the war the German [[Right-wing politics|right]] was committed to an annexationist program which aimed at Germany annexing most of Europe and Africa. Consequently, any peace treaty that did not leave Germany as the conqueror would be unacceptable to them.<ref name=\"Evans, Richard page 107\">Evans, Richard ''In Hitler's Shadow'', New York: Panatheon 1989, p. 107.</ref> Short of allowing Germany to keep all the conquests of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Evans argued that there was nothing that could have been done to persuade the German right to accept Versailles.<ref name=\"Evans, Richard page 107\"/> Evans further noted that the parties of the [[Weimar Coalition]], namely the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), the [[social liberalism|social liberal]] [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP) and the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], were all equally opposed to Versailles, and it is false to claim as some historians have that opposition to Versailles also equalled opposition to the [[Weimar Republic]].<ref name=\"Evans, Richard page 107\"/> Finally, Evans argued that it is untrue that Versailles caused the premature end of the Republic, instead contending that it was the [[Great Depression]] of the early 1930s that put an end to German democracy. He also argued that Versailles was not the \"main cause\" of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] and the German economy was \"only marginally influenced by the impact of reparations\".<ref name=\"Evans, Richard page 107\"/>\r\n\r\n[[Ewa Thompson]] points out that the treaty allowed numerous nations in [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe to liberate themselves from oppressive German rule, a fact that is often neglected by Western historiography, more interested in understanding the German point of view. In nations that found themselves free as the result of the treaty—such as [[Poles]] or [[Czechs]]—it is seen as a symbol of recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by their much larger aggressive neighbours.<ref>The Surrogate Hegemon in Polish Postcolonial Discourse Ewa Thompson, Rice University [http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~ethomp/The%20Surrogate%20Hegemon.pdf]</ref>\r\n\r\nResentment caused by the treaty sowed fertile psychological ground for the eventual rise of the [[Nazi Party]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zsrwjxs/revision/4 |work=BBC Bitesize |title=Why the Nazis achieved power}}</ref> But the German-born Australian historian Jürgen Tampke argued that it was \"a perfidious distortion of history\" to argue that the terms prevented the growth of democracy in Germany and aided the growth of the Nazi party; saying that its terms were not as punitive as often held and that German hyper-inflation in the 1920s was partly a deliberate policy to minimise the cost of repatriations. As an example of the arguments against the ''Versaillerdiktat'' he quotes Elizabeth Wiskemann who heard two officer's widows in Wiesbaden complaining that \"with their stocks of linen depleted they had to have their linen washed once a fortnight (every two weeks) instead of once a month!\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Tampke  |first= Jürgen |title= A Perfidious Distortion of History  |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 2017 |publisher= Scribe |location= Melbourne |isbn= 978-192532-1-944  |oclc= |pages= vii,xii }}</ref>\r\n\r\nThe German historian [[Detlev Peukert]] wrote that Versailles was far from the impossible peace that most Germans claimed it was during the [[interwar period]], and though not without flaws was actually quite reasonable to Germany.<ref name=\"Peukert, Detlev page 278\">Peukert, Detlev ''The Weimar Republic'', New York: Hill & Wang, 1992 p. 278.</ref> Rather, Peukert argued that it was widely believed in Germany that Versailles was a totally unreasonable treaty, and it was this \"perception\" rather than the \"reality\" of the Versailles treaty that mattered.<ref name=\"Peukert, Detlev page 278\"/> Peukert noted that because of the \"[[Millenarianism|millenarian hopes]]\" created in Germany during World War I when for a time it appeared that Germany was on the verge of conquering all of Europe, any peace treaty the [[Allies of World War I]] imposed on the defeated ''[[German Reich]]'' were bound to create a nationalist backlash, and there was nothing the Allies could have done to avoid that backlash.<ref name=\"Peukert, Detlev page 278\"/> Having noted that much, Peukert commented that the policy of [[rapprochement]] with the Western powers that [[Gustav Stresemann]] carried out between 1923 and 1929 were constructive policies that might have allowed Germany to play a more positive role in Europe, and that it was not true that German democracy was doomed to die in 1919 because of Versailles.<ref name=\"Peukert, Detlev page 278\"/> Finally, Peukert argued that it was the Great Depression and the turn to a nationalist policy of [[autarky]] within Germany at the same time that finished off the Weimar Republic, not the Treaty of Versailles.<ref name=\"Peukert, Detlev page 278\"/>\r\n\r\nFrench historian Raymond Cartier states that millions of Germans in the [[Sudetenland]] and in [[Posen-West Prussia]] were placed under foreign rule in a hostile environment, where harassment and violation of rights by authorities are documented.<ref name=\"Cartier\">La Seconde Guerre mondiale, Raymond Cartier, Paris, Larousse Paris Match, 1965, quoted in: {{cite news|first=Pater Lothar|last=Groppe|title=Die \"Jagd auf Deutsche\" im Osten: Die Verfolgung begann nicht erst mit dem \"Bromberger Blutsonntag\" vor 50 Jahren|url=http://www.webarchiv-server.de/pin/archiv04/3504paz38.htm|work=Preußische Allgemeine Zeitung / 28.

Historian Robert Peckham wrote that the issue of Schleswig \"was premised on a gross simplification of the region's history. ... Versailles ignored any possibility of there being a third way: the kind of compact represented by the Swiss Federation; a bilingual or even trilingual Schleswig-Holsteinian state\" or other options such as \"a Schleswigian state in a loose confederation with Denmark or Germany, or an autonomous region under the protection of the League of Nations.\"<ref name=\"Ingrao, p. 262\">Ingrao, p. 262</ref> In regards to the East Prussia plebiscite, historian Richard Blanke wrote that \"no other contested ethnic group has ever, under un-coerced conditions, issued so one-sided a statement of its national preference\".<ref name=\"Ingrao, p. 262\"/> Richard Debo wrote \"both Berlin and Warsaw believed the [[Polish&ndash;Soviet War|Soviet invasion of Poland]] had influenced the East Prussian plebiscites. Poland appeared so close to collapse that even Polish voters had cast their ballots for Germany\".<ref name=Debo335>Debo, p. 335</ref>\r\n\r\nIn regards to the Silesian plebiscite, Blanke observed \"given that the electorate was at least 60% Polish-speaking, this means that about one 'Pole' in three voted for Germany\" and \"most Polish observers and historians\" have concluded that the outcome of plebiscite was due to \"unfair German advantages of incumbency and socio-economic position\". Blanke alleged \"coercion of various kinds even in the face of an allied occupation regime\" occurred, and that Germany granted votes to those \"who had been born in Upper Silesia but no longer resided there\". Blanke concluded that despite these protests \"there is plenty of other evidence, including Reichstag election results both before and after 1921 and the large-scale emigration of Polish-speaking Upper Silesians to Germany after 1945, that their identification with Germany in 1921 was neither exceptional nor temporary\" and \"here was a large population of Germans and Poles—not coincidentally, of the same Catholic religion—that not only shared the same living space but also came in many cases to see themselves as members of the same national community\".<ref name=Bullivant4344/> Prince [[Eustachy Sapieha]], the Polish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], alleged that Soviet Russia \"appeared to be intentionally delaying negotiations\" to end the Polish-Soviet War \"with the object of influencing the Upper Silesian plebiscite\".<ref name=Debo335/> Once the region was partitioned, both \"Germany and Poland attempted to 'cleanse' their shares of Upper Silesia\" via oppression resulting in Germans migrating to Germany and Poles migrating to Poland. Despite the oppression and migration, Opole Silesia \"remained ethnically mixed.\"<ref name=Ther123/>\r\n\r\nFrank Russell wrote that, in regards to the Saar plebiscite, the inhabitants \"were not terrorized at the polls\" and the \"totalitarian [Nazi] German regime was not distasteful to most of the Saar inhabitants and that they preferred it even to an efficient, economical, and benevolent international rule.\" When the outcome of the vote became known, 4,100 (including 800 refugees who had previously fled Germany) residents fled over the border into France.<ref name=\"Russell, pp. 103–106\"/>\r\n\r\n===Military terms and violations===\r\nDuring the formulation of the treaty, the British wanted Germany to abolish conscription but be allowed to maintain a volunteer Army. The French wanted Germany to maintain a conscript army of up to 200,000 men in order to justify their own maintenance of a similar force. Thus the treaty's allowance of 100,000 volunteers was a compromise between the British and French positions. Germany, on the other hand, saw the terms as leaving them defenseless against any potential enemy.<ref>Schmitt, pp. 104–105</ref> [[Bernadotte Everly Schmitt]] wrote that \"there is no reason to believe that the Allied governments were insincere when they stated at the beginning of Part V of the Treaty ... that in order to facilitate a general reduction of the armament of all nations, Germany was to be required to disarm first.\" A lack of American ratification of the treaty or joining the League of Nations left France unwilling to disarm, which resulted in a German desire to rearm.<ref name=\"Schmitt104\"/> Schmitt argued \"had the four Allies remained united, they could have forced Germany really to disarm, and the German will and capacity to resist other provisions of the treaty would have correspondingly diminished.\"<ref>Schmitt, p. 108</ref>\r\n\r\nMax Hantke and Mark Spoerer wrote \"military and economic historians [have] found that the German military only insignificantly exceeded the limits\" of the treaty prior to 1933.<ref name=\"Hantke, p. 852\"/> [[Adam Tooze]] concurred, and wrote \"To put this in perspective, annual military spending by the Weimar Republic was counted not in the billions but in the hundreds of millions of ''Reichsmarks''\"; for example, the Weimar Republic's 1931 program of {{nowrap|480 million}} ''Reichsmarks'' over five years compared to the Nazi Government's 1933 plan to spend {{nowrap|4.4 billion}} ''Reichsmarks'' per year.<ref>Tooze, pp. 26, 53–54</ref> P. M. H. Bell argued that the British Government was aware of later Weimar rearming, and lent public respectability to the German efforts by not opposing them,<ref name=\"Bell, p. 229\"/> an opinion shared by Churchill.<ref>The Second World War</ref> [[Norman Davies]] wrote that \"a curious oversight\" of the military restrictions were that they \"did not include rockets in its list of prohibited weapons\", which provided [[Wernher von Braun]] an area to research within eventually resulting in \"his break [that] came in 1943\" leading to the development of the [[V-2 rocket]].<ref>Davies, p. 416</ref>\r\n\r\n=== Rise of the Nazis ===\r\nThe Treaty created much resentment in Germany, which was exploited by [[Adolf Hitler]] in his rise to power at the helm of [[Nazi Germany]]. Central to this was belief in the [[stab-in-the-back myth]], which held that the German army had not lost the war and had been betrayed by the [[Weimar Republic]], who negotiated an unnecessary surrender. The [[Great Depression]] exacerbated the issue, and led to a collapse of the German economy. Though the treaty may not have caused the crash, it was a convenient scapegoat. Germans viewed the treaty as a humiliation, and eagerly listened to Hitler's oratory which blamed the treaty for Germany's ills. Hitler promised to reverse the depredations of the Allied powers and recover Germany's lost territory and pride, which has led to the treaty being cited as a [[Causes of World War II|cause of World War II]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hitler-reoccupies-the-rhineland|title=Hitler reoccupies the Rhineland, violating the Treaty of Versailles|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/treaty-of-versailles-hitlers-rise-power-1221351|title=How the Treaty of Versailles Contributed to Hitler's Rise to Power|last=M.
